Use this file to describe the _repository_. Include sections such as
why this repository exists (class project), major high-level stuff about
the code (e.g., that it's a Flask app along with a provided Dockerfile,
major dependencies such as argus and sklearn). Also provide a quickstart
for how someone might run this app on their own. Something simple like
"just use docker-compose and run it with a command like ____, yo." except
pls be more formal than I am being right now.

Point someone to the report.md, also.

I dunno, just make it nice.

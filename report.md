Use this file for your final report. I don't care where you write it,
but if you write it directly in this file and commit your work in chunks,
then it will list individual person-contributions, and yay acknowledgements

Your report should follow CRISP-DM format. The final section, `Deployment`,
should describe the app's overall use case, purpose, etc. How it integrates
the model(s) created and described in the preceding report sections.
